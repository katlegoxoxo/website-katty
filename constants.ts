      { title: 'The Challenge', icon: 'fas fa-bullseye', content: 'Manually tailoring a resume for every job application is time-consuming and often fails to pass initial screening by Applicant Tracking Systems (ATS). This project\'s goal was to automate this process, creating highly relevant, keyword-optimized resumes that capture a recruiter\'s attention.' },
      { title: 'Core Functionality', icon: 'fas fa-cogs', content: 'The application provides a clean, step-by-step interface for users to input their career history, education, and skills. By providing a target job description, users trigger an AI-powered process that analyzes the requirements and strategically rewrites their bullet points to align perfectly with the role.' },
      { title: 'Technical Breakdown', icon: 'fas fa-code-branch', content: 'Built with React and TypeScript for a type-safe frontend, the application communicates with a Node.js backend that securely handles requests to the Gemini API. The core logic involves sophisticated prompt engineering to instruct the model to act as a professional resume writer, extracting key verbs and metrics from the job description and weaving them into the user\'s experience. The final resume is then generated as a downloadable PDF.' },
      { title: 'Key Learning', icon: 'fas fa-lightbulb', content: 'The main challenge was in prompt designâ€”ensuring the AI produced consistently high-quality, professional, and grammatically correct content. This required iterative testing and refining the instructions given to the model, which provided deep insights into the nuances of controlling generative AI outputs.' }

The primary objective was to present this complex analysis in a simple, visually intuitive dashboard.' },
      { title: 'User Interaction', icon: 'fas fa-mouse-pointer', content: 'The user experience is centered around a single text input area. After pasting their content and clicking "Analyze," the results are displayed almost instantly. The UI uses color-coding and clear iconography to immediately convey the overall sentiment before the user even reads the details.' },
      { title: 'Technical Implementation', icon: 'fas fa-microchip', content: 'This project leverages the Gemini API\'s JSON mode for structured data output. The React frontend sends the user\'s text and receives a clean JSON object containing the sentiment, confidence score, and influential keywords. This data is then fed into D3.js and Chart.js components to render dynamic, animated gauges and charts, providing a rich data visualization experience.' },
